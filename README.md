# DesktopCamera
A mod that allows Desktop users use the VRChat Camera feature, yay!

> **Disclaimer:**
> This mod uses [VRCModLoader](https://github.com/Slaynash/VRCModLoader) to work properly, so you will need to install that first.

>  **Warning:**
>  The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.

>  **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**, I am not responsible for any bans or any punishments you may get by using this mod!

## How to use
> Click the Camera button in the ESC menu, you will have new options.  
> The explanation below can be confusing, I recommend you to just try it in-game after reading.  
> If you can improve it, please send a pull request.

### **Arrow Keys feature explanation:**
> You can move the camera/viewer position using the arrow keys **(TIP: if you hold shift it moves 2x faster)**.  
> You can change the camera's proximity using Page Up (moves away) and Page Down (moves close) buttons.

#### If you have a numpad:  
> You can rotate it pressing 2 and 8 (tilt up and down), 4 and 6 (tilt left and right), 7 and 9 (orientation);
> You can make the viewer look at you by pressing 1;  
> You can reset the camera and the viewer by pressing 3;  
> You can take a picture using the Plus button (+), and you can toggle the Camera Movement using the Minus button (-).  

### **Move Around Camera feature explanation:**
> The camera will rotate around the user's camera instead of just going to another dimension.

### **Camera Movement feature explanation:**
> Remember the arrow keys feature above? So, this is a toggle, you can toggle between the actual Camera and the Viewer, if you have it on the Camera, the arrow/numpad keys will move the Camera, if you have it on the Viewer, then the Viewer will move instead.  
> The Viewer is the Camera view, if it's not obvious.  
> **Warning: The Camera Space must be in "World" mode, or else the camera won't move**.
