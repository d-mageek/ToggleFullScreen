# VRCDesktopCamera
Just another try to let Desktop users use the Camera, plus bad code, yay!

> **Disclaimer:**
> This mod uses [VRCModLoader](https://github.com/Slaynash/VRCModLoader) to work properly, so you will need to install that first.
>  
>  **Warning:**
>  The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.
