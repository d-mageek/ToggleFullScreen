This repository contains my VRChat mods and fixes. <br>
Join the [VRChat Modding Group discord](https://discord.gg/rCqKSvR) for official mods and support!

## Special Thanks
Thank you [Nitro. <3](https://github.com/nitrog0d) for the idea on the ToggleFullScreen <br>
Also thank you cutie ([Gompo <3](https://github.com/gompocp)) for helping me with literally everything lol.

## ProneUiFix
Current features:
- Simple fix to the Desktop Ui glitch that happens on some avatars that opening the menu while you're proning will cause it be mispositioned.

## ToggleFullScreen
Current features:
- Adds a simple toggle on "Settings -> Other Options Panel" that allows you to toggle Full-Screen Mode without getting a scuffed resolution and actually using your entire screen lol.

## Installation
Before installing:  
**Modding itself is against VRChat's ToS, so, according to the staff, it can lead to punishment, this mod included. Be careful while using this! I'm not responsible for any punishments.**

You will need [MelonLoader](https://discord.gg/2Wn3N2P) (discord link, see \#how-to-install).
After that, drop the mods .dll files in the `Mods` folder in your game's directory.
