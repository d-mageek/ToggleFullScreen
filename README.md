## Special Thanks
To nitro. that gave the idea x)

## ToggleFullScreen
Current features:
- Adds a simple toggle on "Settings -> Other Options Panel" that allows you to toggle Full-Screen Mode without getting a scuffed resolution and actually using your entire screen lol.

## Installation
Before installing:  
**Modding itself is against VRChat's ToS, so, according to the staff, it can lead to punishment, this mod included. Be careful while using this! I'm not responsible for any punishments.**

You will need [MelonLoader](https://discord.gg/2Wn3N2P) (discord link, see \#how-to-install).
After that, drop the mod .dll file in the `Mods` folder in your game's directory.
