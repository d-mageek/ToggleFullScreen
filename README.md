A mod that lets you tweak the VRChat Steadycam (or smooth camera) feature, it also lets Desktop users use it.

* **Warning:** The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.

* **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**, I am not responsible for any bans or any punishments you may get by using this mod!

## Installation
* **Make sure you have run the [MelonLoader Installer](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) by [LavaGang](https://github.com/LavaGang) first (feel free to join the [VRChat Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/jgvc9Fd) for help!).**
* Download the [latest version](https://github.com/nitrog0d/BetterSteadycam/releases/latest/download/BetterSteadycam.dll) of the mod.
* Drag/copy the DLL files that you have downloaded into the Mods folder.
* That's it! Now just run the game and the mod should be installed!
