# VRCDesktopCamera
Just another try to let Desktop users use the Camera, plus bad code, yay!

> **Disclaimer:**
> This mod uses [VRCModLoader](https://github.com/Slaynash/VRCModLoader) to work properly, so you will need to install that first.

>  **Warning:**
>  The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.

>  **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**, I am not responsible for any bans or any punishments you may get by using this mod!

## How to use
> Click the Camera button in the ESC menu, you'll have some new options.

> **Arrow Keys feature explanation:** You can move the camera position using the arrows keys in your keyboard **(tip: if you hold shift it moves 2x faster)**.  
> If you have a numpad, you can rotate it pressing 2 and 8 (tilt up and down), 4 and 6 (tilt left and right), 7 and 9 (orientation), you can make the camera look at you pressing 1, and you can also reset the camera pressing 3, and you can take a picture pressing +.  
> You can also change the camera's proximity using Page Up (moves away) and Page Down (moves close).

> **Move Around Camera feature explanation:** The camera will rotate around the user's camera instead of just going to another dimension.
